This package is inspired by the book of Ray Dalio, Principles.
The idea is to pose a number of principle questions to make more informed, rational decisions. These can be saved and the endgoal is to be able to abstract a personal working algorithm from it.

Development track:

[x] create cli application basis
[ ] create orchestrating logic to run continuously
[x] create sqllite db interface
[x] create generalised principle questions interface
[ ] create simple algorithm interface based on database.First guesstimate is decision tree algorithm or logistic regression.

If you would like to contribute, fork the package (ADD github url) and make a PR.
