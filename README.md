This package is inspired by the book of Ray Dalio, Principles.
The idea is to pose a number of principle questions to make more informed, rational decisions. These can be saved and the endgoal is to be able to abstract a personal working algorithm from it.

Development track:

[] create cli application basis
[] create orchestrating logic to run continuously
[] create sqllite db interface
[] create generalised principle questions interface
[] create simple algorithm interface based on database, first guesstimate is linear regression or decision tree algorithm

If you would like to contribute, fork the package (ADD github url) and make a PR.
